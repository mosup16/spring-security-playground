# Spring Security Playground

this repo was developed during taking [The Course In This Playlist By This Awesome Guy](https://https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEocw3gLFc8XRaRBZkhBEZ_R3tmvfkWZz).

**Note** that this repo contains multiple projects.
The projects are just a proof of concept for spring security, and are far from being complete.
The projects are uploaded in a bulk fashion and with tons of code
that needs serious refactoring. The projects also aren't a mere copy of the previously mentioned playlist examples.
